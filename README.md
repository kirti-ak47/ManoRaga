# 🎵 ManoRaga  
### Healing the mind through Indian classical music using Gemini AI

ManoRaga is an AI-powered recommendation system that suggests **Indian classical ragas** based on a user’s emotional state. By combining **neuromusicology principles** with **Gemini AI reasoning**, ManoRaga bridges ancient musical wisdom and modern artificial intelligence to support mental and emotional well-being.

## 🌱 Inspiration

Indian classical music has long used ragas as structured emotional frameworks. Each raga is associated with specific moods, psychological effects, and even times of day. ManoRaga was inspired by the idea of applying modern AI reasoning to this traditional knowledge to create a meaningful, culturally rooted mental wellness tool.

## ✨ What it does

- Accepts a user’s emotional state in natural language  
- Identifies the dominant emotion using AI reasoning  
- Recommends the most suitable Indian classical raga  
- Explains how the raga supports mental and emotional balance  
- Ensures recommendations are grounded in a structured dataset  

---

## 🛠️ How it works

1. A CSV dataset stores ragas and their emotional benefits  
2. User input is combined with the dataset  
3. Gemini AI reasons over the structured data  
4. The system selects the best-matching raga  
5. A calm and supportive explanation is generated  

Mathematically, the recommendation can be viewed as:

\[
f(e) = \arg\max_{r \in R} \text{EmotionalAlignment}(e, r)
\]

where \( e \) is the user’s emotional state and \( r \) is a raga from the dataset.
